# Live example with CodePen

Grid's dependencies are available for Codepen, making it simple to create your own live demonstration. The live example imitated issues are very significant because it helps us in our investigation and save us time. To create a live example page you can follow the below instructions:
- Sign up for a [CodePen](https://codepen.io) account or log in if you already have one.
- Open this [EFX Grid template](https://codepen.io/kkpornch/pen/RwBxwJx).
- Fork the template by clicking the fork button in the bottom right of the screen.
- Modify the code in live example as desired and save it.
- Send us the URL.
