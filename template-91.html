<h1 id="migration-recommendation">Migration Recommendation</h1>
<p>When it comes to grids, there are several versions available, with EFX Grid being the latest one. We highly recommend migrating to EFX Grid, whether you&#39;re currently using Emerald Grid or Atlas Blotter. This migration should seamlessly integrate with Element Framework v6 or v7 and ensure smooth functionality.</p>
