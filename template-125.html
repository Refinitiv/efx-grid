<h1 id="saveload-grid-config">Save/Load grid config</h1>
<p>In efx-grid, we provide the developer with can implement save/load grid config for restoring config to the grid. This behavior helps the developer with implementation, Such as undo/redo functionality.
Where the grid has static data, which you can use <code>setStaticData</code> or <code>setStaticRowData</code> in runtime, the grid will store this information, and then when you want to use this config, you can just set this config into the grid.
We divide the example into two examples.</p>
<p>First, we have the grid and some data in the grid. You can set static data by clicking the button, and then the grid will change states, such as row coloring and segment color. And then, when you want to save this state, you can click “Save config,” and the grid will return the current state and copied to your clipboard. Then when you have a clipboard, you can pass it into example 2. Then click &quot;Start Grid&quot; and both grids look the same. </p>
